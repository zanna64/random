  <h3>PJO</h3>
  <p>
    PJO is about Greek mythology and children of the Greek gods, called demigods or half-bloods. It mostly takes place in America. The main character, Percy, is a son of Poseidon, god of the sea. Poseidon is a powerful god, one of the Big Three(Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades). Long ago, after World War II to be exact, the Big Three took an oath to not have any demigod children due to an important prophecy regarding a child of the Big Three. Since Percy was born long after this oath, he gets the attention of the gods and goes on several quests, leading to the fulfillment of the Great Prophecy.
